# Simulation

*hard*

Student should have basic knowledge on computer architecture, such as the concept of
CPU cache, RAM, SIMD and CUDA. We will further explore these high performance computing
tasks as well as compiler engineering in Julia language from this project.

## BQCESubroutine

Implement the code generator with multithreading and CUDA kernel for the tiny
kernel DSL.
